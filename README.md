# PyBaMM EIS
PyBaMM EIS rapidly calculates the electrochemical impedance of any battery model defined using PyBaMM.


This code was developed as part of the Oxford Mathematics Summer Project _"Efficient Linear Algebra Methods to Determine Li-ion Battery Behaviour"_. 

Student: Rishit Dhoot

Supervisors: Prof Colin Please and Dr. Robert Timms

## ðŸ”‹ Using PyBaMM EIS
The easiest way to use PyBaMM EIS is to compute the impedance of a model of your choice with the default parameters:
```python3
import pbeis
import pybamm

model = pybamm.lithium_ion.DFN(options={"surface form": "differential"})  # DFN with capacitance
eis_sim = pbeis.EISSimulation(model)
eis_sim.solve(pbeis.logspace(-4, 4, 30))  # calculate impedance at log-spaced frequencies
eis_sim.nyquist_plot()
```

## ðŸ’» About PyBaMM
The example simulations use the package [PyBaMM](www.pybamm.org) (Python Battery Mathematical Modelling). PyBaMM solves physics-based electrochemical DAE models by using state-of-the-art automatic differentiation and numerical solvers. The Doyle-Fuller-Newman model can be solved in under 0.1 seconds, while the reduced-order Single Particle Model and Single Particle Model with electrolyte can be solved in just a few milliseconds. Additional physics can easily be included such as thermal effects, fast particle diffusion, 3D effects, and more. All models are implemented in a flexible manner, and a wide range of models and parameter sets (NCA, NMC, LiCoO2, ...) are available. There is also functionality to simulate any set of experimental instructions, such as CCCV or GITT, or specify drive cycles.

## ðŸš€ Installation
In order to run the notebooks in this repository you will need to instal a number of packages. We recommend installing within a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) in order to not alter any python distribution files on your machine.

PyBaMM is available on GNU/Linux, MacOS and Windows. For more detailed instructions on how to install PyBaMM, see [the PyBaMM documentation](https://pybamm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/GNU-linux.html#user-install).

### Linux/Mac OS
To install the requirements on Linux/Mac OS use the following terminal commands:

1. Clone the repository
```bash
https://github.com/rish31415/pybamm-eis
```
2. Change into the `pybamm-eis` directory 
```bash
cd pybamm-eis
```
3. Create a virtual environment
```bash
virtualenv env
```
4. Activate the virtual environment 
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```
5. Install the `pbeis` package
```bash 
pip install .
```

### Windows
To install the requirements on Windows use the following commands:

1. Clone the repository
```bash
https://github.com/rish31415/pybamm-eis
```
2. Change into the `pybamm-eis` directory 
```bash
cd pybamm-eis
```
3. Activate the virtual environment 
```bash
\path\to\env\Scripts\activate
```
where `\path\to\env` is the path to the environment created in step 2 (e.g. `C:\Users\'Username'\env\Scripts\activate.bat`).

4. Install the `pbeis` package
```bash 
pip install .
```

As an alternative, you can set up [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about). This allows you to run a full Linux distribution within Windows.

### Developer 
To install as a developer follow the instructions above, replacing the final step with 
```bash
pip install -e .
```
This will allow you to edit the code locally.
